## GitHub Contribution Script

I am posting this for educational purposes only. I don't recommend you to do this to get an unfair advantage over others.

###### Before you continue:
- Make sure you have installed [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
- Make sure you have a code editor, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Have a basic understanding of JavaScript and GitHub.

###### Required packages:
- `jsonfile`
- `moment`
- `simple-git`
- `random`

### Q: How do I use this?
A: If you don't know how to work this then you shouldn't be messing with it. But here's a how-to regardless.
1. Make a new private repository and clone it using `SSH`.
2. Within your cloned repository make two new files, `index.js` and `data.json`.
3. Paste the source provided in `index.js` and replace `100` on line **11** with however many contributions you want to make.

Example:
```js
//this will send 500 contributions.
let requests = 500;

//this will send 10 contributions.
let requests = 10;
```

4. Type `node index` in your terminal.

### Q: Can this get me banned?
A: Honestly, I have no idea. I'm not responsible for anyone using this for an unfair advantage.

### Q: Why are you releasing this?
A: I was bored and figured why not, enjoy.
